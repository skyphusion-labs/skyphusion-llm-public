# Changelog

## v0.4.1

- Correct Grok model IDs to match the actual xAI catalog: `grok-4.3`, `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309`, `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning`, `grok-build-0.1`
- Remove the v0.3.0 stub IDs (`grok-4.20`, `grok-4.1-fast`) that didn't resolve at xAI

## v0.4.0

- Provider keys now preferred via AI Gateway dashboard (BYOK Store Keys) rather than Worker secrets
- Worker auth headers are conditional: if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` is set, the inline key is sent; if not, the request goes through with no provider auth header and the gateway injects the stored key from Provider Keys configuration
- Added optional `CF_AIG_TOKEN` Worker secret for Authenticated Gateway support (sends `cf-aig-authorization` header when set)
- Removed the hard error when keys are missing; selecting an Anthropic or xAI model with no provider auth configured anywhere now surfaces the upstream provider's 401, which is more informative

## v0.3.0

- Add xAI / Grok models (Grok 4.20, Grok 4.3, Grok 4.1 Fast) via BYOK
- `provider` field on model entries gains `"xai"` value
- xAI dispatch is simpler than Anthropic: OpenAI-compatible wire format, no message transform, standard Bearer token auth
- `max_completion_tokens` used instead of `max_tokens` to support reasoning models (Grok 4.x)
- `XAI_API_KEY` worker secret required to enable xAI models; absence returns a clear error
- README documents the BYOK setup parallel to Anthropic's section

## v0.2.0

- Add Anthropic Claude models (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5) via BYOK
- New `provider` field on model entries dispatches between Workers AI binding and Anthropic direct fetch
- BYOK calls go through the AI Gateway Anthropic provider endpoint, preserving caching/logging/rate-limiting
- Image content blocks transform from OpenAI-style `image_url` to Anthropic-style `image` with base64 source
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` worker secret required to enable Anthropic models; absence returns a clear error

## v0.1.0 (initial public release)

- Single Cloudflare Worker fronting AI Gateway
- 13 chat models, 3 image-generation models, 3 TTS models from the Workers AI catalog
- Multimodal chat input: text, images (vision), audio (Whisper transcription), video (8 client-extracted keyframes)
- D1 for chat history, R2 for input and output binary artifacts
- Cloudflare Access for authentication, per-user history scoping, per-object ownership checks via R2 customMetadata
- Vanilla TypeScript Worker, vanilla JS frontend, no build step beyond tsc
- Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline
- Optgrouped model dropdown with capability-aware UI re-skin per model type
